# Titanic Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is a personal project aimed at demonstrating basic skills in data analysis and visualization using Python. The project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to showcase the following skills:
- Data cleaning and manipulation with `pandas`
- Data visualization with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Basic statistical analysis and insights extraction

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **pandas**: For data manipulation
- **seaborn**: For visualizing data
- **matplotlib**: For creating custom plots
- **numpy**: For numerical operations

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Visualization of survival rates based on passenger class and gender
- Distribution of passenger ages with mean indicator
- Correlation heatmap of the dataset's features

This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with data, clean it, and generate meaningful insights using Python's data science libraries.
