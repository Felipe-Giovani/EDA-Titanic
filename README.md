Titanic Survival Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, aiming to uncover insights into the characteristics of the passengers and the factors that influenced their chances of survival. The dataset provides details about each passenger, including their age, gender, class, and survival status, which can be analyzed to identify patterns and correlations.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic's maiden voyage, including:

Passenger ID
Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class)
Name, gender, and age
Number of siblings or spouses aboard
Number of parents or children aboard
Ticket number and fare
Cabin number and port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

To clean and prepare the data for analysis.
To explore relationships between survival rates and factors such as ticket class, gender, and age.
To visualize data using Python's plotting libraries, like matplotlib and seaborn.
To identify interesting patterns that might influence a passenger’s chance of survival.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For basic visualizations.
Seaborn: For creating more complex, aesthetic visualizations.

Key Steps in the Project
Data Loading: Loading the dataset using pandas.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting columns, and dropping irrelevant data.
Data Exploration:
Understanding the distribution of different variables (e.g., age, gender, class).
Examining correlations between features like Pclass, Sex, and Survival.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to display trends and correlations.
Bar plots showing survival rates by class and gender.
Histograms to display the age distribution of passengers.
Heatmaps to show correlations between variables.
Code Example
python
Copiar código
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")

# Clean the data
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Example analysis: Survival by class
sns.barplot(x="Pclass", y="Survived", data=df)
plt.title("Survival Rate by Class")
plt.show()

# Example analysis: Distribution of Age
sns.histplot(df['Age'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title("Age Distribution of Passengers")
plt.show()
Visualizations
Throughout this project, several visualizations are used to present findings clearly:

Bar charts to show the relationship between ticket class, gender, and survival rates.
Histograms to analyze the distribution of passengers' ages.
Heatmaps to explore correlations between features.
Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the factors that influenced passengers' survival chances on the Titanic. For example, it shows that women and children in higher classes had better survival rates. These insights are useful for understanding how social status and demographics affected the likelihood of survival in historical tragedies.

Future Work
More sophisticated analysis using machine learning techniques (such as logistic regression or decision trees) to predict survival.
Further exploration of cabin numbers, ticket numbers, and fares.
